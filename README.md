FAHM – Arabic Sign Language Translator

FAHM is a mobile application designed to bridge the communication gap between Deaf and non-Deaf individuals in Arabic-speaking communities by providing real-time translation of Arabic Sign Language (ArSL) into text and speech.

Built using Flutter, FAHM integrates AI and computer vision technologies to deliver an intuitive and interactive user experience. The app empowers Deaf users to communicate independently while helping non-Deaf users understand ArSL gestures instantly — fostering inclusivity and accessibility.

 Motivation

  Millions of Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals face communication barriers due to limited awareness and resources surrounding sign language. In Arabic-speaking countries, this          challenge is intensified by the lack of tools dedicated to Arabic Sign Language (ArSL).

  FAHM was developed as a proof of concept to address this gap by leveraging AI-powered and computer vision technologies to enhance communication, promote education, and foster inclusion.

 Objectives

   Bridge the communication gap between Deaf and non-Deaf individuals.

   Promote awareness and education of Arabic Sign Language.

   Encourage inclusivity and social connection through accessible technology.

   Lay the groundwork for future features such as text-to-sign translation for two-way communication.

 Vision

  FAHM is more than just a translation tool — it’s a platform for empowerment, education, and inclusion. By addressing communication challenges and promoting Arabic Sign Language           learning, FAHM aims to create a more connected and inclusive society where everyone can communicate freely and effectively.
